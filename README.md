## UI/UX Design Approach

This application is designed specifically for REMWaste to provide a seamless, modern, and user-friendly skip hire experience. The UI/UX approach focuses on:

### Clarity and Simplicity
- Clean, modern layout with clear typography and generous white space, making navigation intuitive for all users.
- Prominent call-to-action and step-by-step guidance help users easily progress through the skip selection and booking process.

### Guided Selection Process
- A visual progress bar at the top shows users their current step, reducing confusion and increasing confidence.
- The skip selection grid displays all available options with essential details (size, price, restrictions) at a glance.

### Efficient Search and Filtering
- Users can quickly filter skips by relevant criteria (e.g., "All Skips", "Road Allowed", "Heavy Waste") using visually distinct filter buttons.
- The search bar allows direct access to specific skip sizes, catering to both browsing and targeted search behaviors.

### Focused Detail View
- Selecting a skip opens a sidebar overlay with detailed information and a large image, keeping users engaged without navigating away from the main page.
- The "Continue with Selection" button is fixed at the bottom of the sidebar, ensuring the next action is always clear and accessible.

### Accessibility and Responsiveness
- High-contrast colors and large interactive elements ensure accessibility for all users, including those on mobile devices.
- The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, maintaining usability across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Building Trust and Confidence
- All relevant information (price, hire period, restrictions) is displayed up front, helping users make informed decisions.
- The interface avoids clutter and unnecessary steps, making the process straightforward and trustworthy.

**Summary:**  
This UI/UX approach prioritizes clarity, ease of use, and a modern look, which is especially important for REMWaste customers who may be new to skip hire. The guided process, visual cues, and focused detail view help users confidently select the right skip for their needs, improving both conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
